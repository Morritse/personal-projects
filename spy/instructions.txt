1.3 Pre-Calculate Indicators per Timeframe
Pick a set of indicators that support different styles (momentum, mean reversion, breakout). For each timeframe DataFrame, add columns for these indicators.

Below is an example set:

Momentum Indicators
MACD (12, 26, 9)
RSI (14)
Mean Reversion
Bollinger Bands (20, 2)
Stochastics (14, 3, 3) (optional)
Breakout
Donchian Channels (20) or Pivot Points
Example (5-min Bollinger & MACD)
python
Copy code
# Simple Moving Average
df_5m["SMA20"] = df_5m["Close"].rolling(20).mean()
df_5m["StdDev20"] = df_5m["Close"].rolling(20).std()
df_5m["BollingerUpper"] = df_5m["SMA20"] + 2 * df_5m["StdDev20"]
df_5m["BollingerLower"] = df_5m["SMA20"] - 2 * df_5m["StdDev20"]

# MACD
# For a quick approach: MACD_line = EMA12 - EMA26, Signal_line = EMA9 of MACD_line
df_5m["EMA12"] = df_5m["Close"].ewm(span=12).mean()
df_5m["EMA26"] = df_5m["Close"].ewm(span=26).mean()
df_5m["MACD_line"] = df_5m["EMA12"] - df_5m["EMA26"]
df_5m["Signal_line"] = df_5m["MACD_line"].ewm(span=9).mean()
df_5m["MACD_hist"] = df_5m["MACD_line"] - df_5m["Signal_line"]
(Repeat similarly for df_15m, df_30m, etc., adjusting lookback periods if desired.)

1.4 Save the Pre-Calculated Data
Save each timeframe’s DataFrame to file for fast future loading:

python
Copy code
df_5m.to_parquet("spy_5m_with_indicators.parquet")
df_15m.to_parquet("spy_15m_with_indicators.parquet")
# etc.





2. Strategy “Collection” and Synergy
We want multiple smaller strategies—each focusing on a distinct “view” of the market. Then we can blend or select among them in an online learning approach.

Here’s an example “menu” of strategies:

Short-Term Momentum
Uses 5m MACD crossovers + RSI above/below certain thresholds.
E.g., if MACD_line > Signal_line and RSI < 70, go long on next candle open.
Mean Reversion (Bollinger)
Uses 15m Bollinger Bands.
If price hits lower band and RSI(14) < 30, go long for a quick bounce.
If price hits upper band and RSI(14) > 70, go short.
Breakout / Trend-Following
Uses Donchian channels (20 bars) on 5m or 15m.
If price breaks above recent 20-bar high, go long; if breaks below, go short.
Why These Strategies Are “Synergistic”
Momentum tries to catch continuations after momentum builds.
Mean Reversion tries to fade extremes within a short timeframe.
Breakout tries to catch fresh trends after consolidation.
Because they have different “triggers,” they can complement each other. Sometimes momentum or breakout will do well in trending conditions, while mean reversion picks up range-bound moves.

3. Self-Learning: Integrating the Strategies
Rather than manually combining signals, you can treat each strategy’s signals as features or votes in an online learning model.

3.1 Create “Meta-Features”
For each bar in your chosen timeframe (e.g., 5m), store:

Signal_Momo: +1 if momentum strategy says “long,” -1 if “short,” 0 if flat.
Signal_MeanRev: +1 long, -1 short, 0 flat from your Bollinger approach.
Signal_Breakout: +1 long, -1 short, 0 flat from your breakout approach.
(Plus any numeric confidence scores, e.g., MACD histogram value, distance from Bollinger band, etc.)
You also keep the raw or lightly processed technical indicators themselves if you want the learning model to interpret them directly.

3.2 Label Definition
We need a consistent target (label) for the next bar, e.g.:

Next Bar Return: y = (Close_{t+1} - Close_t) / Close_t
Next Bar Direction: y = 1 if next bar up, 0 if next bar down
Pick something that matches your time horizon (like 5m ahead or 15m ahead).

3.3 Online Learning Flow
Using a library like scikit-learn (SGDClassifier, SGDRegressor) or a small PyTorch neural net:

Initialize the model with an offline “warm-up” on some historical chunk (e.g., last 6 months).
As you paper trade in near real-time (or replay), gather new bars, compute your strategy signals, feed them as X.
Predict the next bar’s direction (or return).
Execute a trade in your paper environment.
Wait for the bar to close → get the true outcome (label).
partial_fit() or optimizer.step() with the new (X, y) data.
This loop continues all day, adapting to changing conditions.

4. Putting It All Together in Practice
Preprocess & Store
One-time creation of spy_5m_with_indicators.parquet, spy_15m_with_indicators.parquet with MACD, Bollinger, Donchian, RSI, etc.
Feature Assembly
For the timeframe you’re trading (say 5m), read in df_5m, compute your “Signal_Momo,” “Signal_MeanRev,” “Signal_Breakout,” and so on.
Combine them with the raw (or lightly processed) indicators in a final DataFrame that has columns [feature1, feature2, feature3, ..., target].
Model Initialization
Train an initial offline model on, say, 1–2 years of historical 5m data.
Live/Paper Loop
For each new 5m bar in live/paper trading:
Compute or load updated features (momentum, mean reversion, breakout signals).
Model predicts next bar direction.
If strong “long” signal → place paper trade (or if short, etc.).
After the bar closes, see actual result → partial_fit() with (X, y).
Ensemble or Weighted Approach (Optional)
Keep separate sub-models for each strategy, or one meta-model that weighs them.
Evaluate your daily/weekly results, watch for drawdowns, potentially revert to a simpler baseline if performance degrades drastically.
5. Next Steps & Tips
Keep It Simple at First
Maybe start with just two strategies (momentum + mean reversion) on one timeframe (5m). Expand once comfortable.
Log Everything
Store your paper trades, signals, and predictions to see what’s working or not.
Gradual Learning Rate
In an online model, use a small learning rate so you don’t overfit to the last bar’s noise.
Check Overlapping Windows
If you do 5m predictions on data that includes 15m indicators, carefully align timestamps. That’s where pre-aggregation pays off.
Watch Real-World Market Hours
If you’re strictly day trading 9:30–16:00 ET, exclude after-hours data to avoid anomalies in your indicators.
Final Thoughts
Pre-Aggregating 1-minute data into 5m (and optionally 15m, 30m) intervals with key indicators drastically simplifies your pipeline and speeds up backtesting/optimizations.
Combining multiple short-term strategies (momentum, mean reversion, breakout) in a single model or an ensemble can give more robust performance across different market conditions.
Letting an online learning model evaluate & update how it weights these signals in near-real-time is a great learning exercise (especially in a paper-trading environment).
Bottom line: This “synergistic” approach—momentum + mean reversion + breakout signals on SPY 5m/15m data—should give you a robust foundation for experimentation. You get a diverse set of signals to feed into your machine learning pipeline, plus you’ll gain hands-on experience with all the key challenges of data alignment, indicator engineering, and adaptive (“self-learning”) strategies. Good luck!
