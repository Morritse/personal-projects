# Deep Learning Trading Model - Google Colab Guide

## Setup Instructions

1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload the `deep_learning_trading.ipynb` notebook
3. In the runtime menu, select "Change runtime type" and set:
   - Hardware accelerator: GPU
   - GPU type: A100 (if available)

## What to Expect

### Data Processing
- The notebook will download historical data for AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, and META
- You'll see an interactive plot showing the price history
- Technical indicators will be calculated and sequences created for training

### Model Training
- Training typically takes 1-2 hours on an A100 GPU
- Expected metrics:
  - Directional accuracy: 55-60% (above random chance)
  - Return prediction MAE: ~0.01-0.02
  - Direction prediction accuracy: ~58-65%

### Key Visualizations
1. Training History
   - Loss curves for both return and direction prediction
   - Validation metrics to monitor overfitting
2. Prediction Analysis
   - Actual vs predicted returns
   - Directional accuracy analysis
   - Interactive plots for detailed inspection

### Model Architecture
The model combines three key components:
1. CNN layers for pattern recognition
2. LSTM layers for temporal dependencies
3. Attention mechanism for focusing on important time steps

### Output Files
The notebook will save:
1. Trained model (`deep_trading_model/`)
2. Training history (`training_history.csv`)
3. TensorBoard logs for detailed analysis

## Tips for Best Results

1. Data Quality
   - More historical data generally improves results
   - Consider adding more symbols for better generalization

2. Training Parameters
   - Batch size of 64 is optimized for GPU
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting
   - Mixed precision training speeds up computation

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Watch the loss curves for convergence
   - Monitor GPU memory usage
   - Use TensorBoard for detailed analysis

4. Common Issues
   - If you run out of GPU memory, reduce batch size
   - If training is unstable, reduce learning rate
   - If overfitting occurs, increase dropout rates

## Next Steps

After training, you can:
1. Use the model for predictions on new data
2. Integrate it with the backtesting pipeline
3. Fine-tune parameters based on performance
4. Add more features or modify the architecture

## Expected Training Time

- Data loading: ~2-3 minutes
- Feature calculation: ~1-2 minutes
- Model training: ~1-2 hours
- Total notebook runtime: ~2-3 hours

## Hardware Requirements

- GPU: NVIDIA A100 (preferred) or V100
- RAM: 12GB+ (GPU memory)
- Storage: 5GB+ for data and model

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

1. Return Prediction
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared value

2. Direction Prediction
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score

3. Trading Performance
   - Directional accuracy
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Prediction confidence

## Troubleshooting

1. GPU Issues
   - Check GPU allocation in Colab
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Restart runtime if necessary

2. Training Issues
   - Learning rate too high/low
   - Gradient exploding/vanishing
   - Batch size too large/small

3. Data Issues
   - Missing values
   - Look-ahead bias
   - Data quality problems

## Customization Options

1. Model Architecture
   - Add/remove layers
   - Modify layer sizes
   - Change activation functions

2. Training Process
   - Adjust learning rate
   - Modify batch size
   - Change sequence length

3. Features
   - Add new technical indicators
   - Include fundamental data
   - Modify sequence creation

## Interpreting Results

1. Good Results Look Like:
   - Directional accuracy > 55%
   - Stable training curves
   - Consistent validation performance
   - Reasonable prediction confidence

2. Warning Signs:
   - Unstable training curves
   - Large validation/training gap
