# Understanding Jupyter Notebooks and This Trading Model

## What is a Jupyter Notebook?
A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that combines:
- Live code that you can run
- Visualizations and plots
- Text explanations and documentation
- The ability to experiment and modify code in real-time

Think of it like a live document where you can:
1. Write and run code
2. See the results immediately
3. Add explanations and notes
4. Create interactive visualizations
5. Share your work with others

## What This Trading Notebook Will Do

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Downloads historical stock data for AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, and META
- Calculates technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Creates visualizations of the stock prices and indicators
- Prepares the data for deep learning

### 2. Model Training
The notebook will train a deep learning model that:
- Predicts both stock returns and price direction
- Uses a combination of CNN, LSTM, and Attention mechanisms
- Leverages the A100 GPU for fast training

### 3. Outputs and Visualizations
You'll see:
- Stock price charts
- Training progress metrics
- Model performance visualizations
- Prediction accuracy metrics

### 4. Saved Results
The notebook will save:
1. The trained model (`deep_trading_model_a100.keras`)
2. Training history (`training_history.csv`)
3. Performance plots
4. TensorBoard logs for detailed analysis

### 5. Key Metrics to Watch
During training, you'll see:
- Loss values (how well the model is learning)
- Return prediction accuracy (MAE and MSE)
- Direction prediction accuracy (% correct up/down predictions)
- Validation metrics (how well it generalizes)

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Setup**
   - Upload to Google Colab
   - Select A100 GPU runtime
   - Run cells in order from top to bottom

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch the training metrics
   - Check the visualizations
   - Review TensorBoard logs

3. **Results**
   - Final model performance metrics
   - Trading strategy insights
   - Saved model for future use

## Expected Runtime
- Data preparation: ~5 minutes
- Model training: ~30-60 minutes on A100
- Total notebook runtime: ~1-1.5 hours

## Output Files
1. **Model Files**
   - `deep_trading_model_a100.keras` (trained model)
   - `best_model.keras` (best checkpoint during training)

2. **Analysis Files**
   - `training_history.csv` (detailed metrics)
   - TensorBoard logs (in `./logs` directory)
   - Performance plots (interactive Plotly visualizations)

3. **Results**
   - Model performance metrics
   - Trading strategy evaluation
   - Feature importance analysis

## Using the Results
The trained model can be used to:
1. Make trading predictions on new data
2. Analyze market patterns
3. Develop trading strategies
4. Backtest performance

## Next Steps
After running the notebook, you can:
1. Modify parameters to improve performance
2. Add more stocks or features
3. Integrate with live trading systems
4. Analyze different time periods
